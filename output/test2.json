        "description": "Founded by sixth-generation Texan, Tito Beveridge, Tito’s Handmade Vodka is known for its high-quality product, charitable contributions, and goal to make people happy while making the world a better place. From the start, Tito got a kick out of infusing vodka for friends and quickly became known as “the vodka guy.” With a dream to do what he loved, and a dog by his side, he pursued a career in the spirits industry, risking it all until he sold his first case. \n\nOver twenty-five years later, Tito’s Handmade Vodka has stayed true to its roots and is designed to be savored by both spirit connoisseurs and those who enjoy a simple cocktail. Our gluten-free, low-calorie* vodka is American-made, unflavored, and distilled using old-fashioned copper pot stills, inspired by the distillation methods of fine single malt scotches and high-end French cognacs. Over 25 years later, the process remains the same; Tito’s is made in batches, with each batch taste-tested, and goes down smooth with an impeccably clean finish. From a Bloody Mary at brunch, a martini at cocktail hour, or a simple Tito’s and soda with friends – just add Tito’s and enjoy! Distilled and bottled on the same land in Austin, Texas, Tito’s Handmade Vodka is made from 100% corn and is naturally gluten-free. Available in Liter, 1.75L, 750mL, 375mL, 200mL, and 50mL sizes. \n\n*(Average Analysis per 1.5oz Tito’s Handmade Vodka: 98 calories, Carbohydrates 0 grams, Protein 0 grams, Fat 0 grams)",

This extra height allows a long interaction to take place between alcohol vapour and copper, and while the new make is decidedly high-toned [the cut points here are quite high] there is still a little note of cereal adding a dry counterpoint. The vast majority of Glenmorangie’s make is aged in ex-American oak casks. Some of the mature spirit is then transferred to ex-fortified wine [Port, Sherry] and still wine casks [Sauternes, Burgundy, Super Tuscan etc] for a period of finishing. Glenmorangie was one of the pioneers of this technique.",

        "description": "Today, unlike most spirits, Black Seal includes products of both pot stills, as used in fine Cognacs, and continuous stills, as used in grappa. One imparts flavour, the other yields a subtle elegance. Together they work wonders.\n\nGosling’s Black Seal has a rich, intricate flavour, well balanced and nuanced with butterscotch, vanilla and caramel. Or, as expressed up by the Beverage Tasting Institute when they awarded it their highest honor, the Platinum Medal: “Deep, assertive and highly flavoured. Very fragrant with herbal ￼￼￼￼￼￼sharpness. At the finish there is a softness and elegance. A most complex, unusual spirit.” We were pleased, but hardly surprised. After all, we’ve been at this awhile.",

The curious, yet marvelous, infusions of rose &amp; cucumber imbue our spirit with its uniquely balanced flavor resulting in an unimpeachably smooth and distinct gin.\nThe Hendrick’s Rickey is a beloved, refreshing and easy-to-make cocktail. However, Ms. Lesley Gracie, chooses to drink it with club soda, elderflower liqueur and garnished with 3 thinly sliced cucumber rounds.\nHand-crafted on the Southwest coast of Scotland in the decidedly un-ginnish town of Girvan, tiny batches of only 500 lovely litres are produced at a time, which gives Ms. Lesley Gracie, our Master Distiller and the inventor of Hendrick’s Gin, greater control of her careful artistry.\nHendrick’s Gin is created via an absurdly inefficient, yet quite glorious process. In essence, to make one gin, we first create two. One on an old-fashioned pot still, yielding a rich and intricate spirit. The other on along-necked Carter Head, producing a delicate, more refined spirit. Each still is infused with an unusual symphony of 11 botanicals. The gins from the two stills are then married together and graced with refreshing infusions of Rose and Cucumber.\nThis odd method of making gin enables Hendrick’s to taste light, yet intriguingly complex. The result is a wondrously refreshing gin with a delightfully floral aroma, elevating any cocktail and all occasions. \nEscape the conventional, and embrace the delectable.",

With light floral fragrances and rich vanilla spices to balance out the sweetness, Jameson is perfect to drink straight up, yet it has enough complexity to blend with any whiskey cocktail. This triple-distilled blend of pot still and fine grain whiskey has been aged in oak casks for a minimum of four years, giving Jameson a distinct caramel flavor that finishes with hints of leather and tobacco. While drinking Jameson, you can experience the reputation and legacy that John Jameson made creating this fine Irish whiskey. Made in Ireland for over 200 years, 40% ABV Jameson delivers a silky smooth and distinct flavor that only comes from a Jameson whiskey. Keep Jameson Original on hand in your liquor cabinet, or give it as a gift to your favorite whiskey lover.",

You don’t change a thing. That’s why Jim Beam Black is, and always will be, extra-aged to taste and bottled only when it’s just right. The result is a full-bodied bourbon with an extra level of elegance and refinement that’s meant to be sipped and savored. And of course, just like its younger brother, our original Jim Beam®, it’s best when shared with others.",

Although many famous bourbons were produced at the Stitzel-Weller Distillery (including Pappy Van Winkle), most shared one unique characteristic pioneered by William Laurel Weller himself — instead of rye, the bourbons used wheat as a secondary grain in their mashbill, lending a softer, smoother flavor to the whiskey.\n\nIn 1936, nearly a century after the original recipe was developed, former Louisville Mayor Charles F. Farnsley officially registered the &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; brand, distilling the bourbon limited batches for exclusive distribution in the southern United States. This practice lasted all the way into the 1980s, when the Stitzel-Weller Distillery was disbanded and Rebel Yell found its way into the hands of LUXCO Spirited Brands. Now, more than 150 years later, Rebel Yell is bridging the gap between its proud heritage and modern tastes, and is available nationwide for the first time in its history.\n\nRebel Yell Small Batch Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey is handcrafted according to the original, time-honored Rebel Yell recipe developed in 1849. Bottled at a slightly higher proof (90.6) than Rebel Yell Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, the Small Batch Reserve has a complex aroma of caramel, oak, vanilla and brown sugar, which leads to similar flavors on the palate, along with notes of wheat crackers and sugar cereal. The finish is subtle, with hints of orange peel and dark chocolate rounding things out.",

Seagram&#39;s own family, to celebrate his son&#39;s upcoming marriage. Upon tasting the special blend, everyone insisted it be put on the market and sure enough it went on to become one of Seagram&#39;s biggest sellers.

Harlen has always wanted to make a premium vodka​ and knows from experience that wheat offers a delicate and balanced flavor profile. The wheat recipe is cooked, fermented, and distilled seven times on the micro-still before being married with a recipe made from other grains and distilled an additional three times.  As Harlen describes it, &quot;This is how vodka is supposed to taste.&quot;\n\nTASTING NOTES:\nPure and crisp on the nose. The fresh and clean taste finishes with hint of soft vanilla. This is the way vodka should taste.\n\nAWARDS:\n2018 Silver Medal - San Francisco World Spirits Competition\n2018 &quot;Great Value&quot; - 90 points - Ultimate Spirits Challenge\n\nREVIEWS:\n&quot;Crisp intense nose with slightly grainy notes.

Since it&#39;s made without any added sugars, you&#39;ll enjoy the full-bodied citrus burst that only comes from using fresh fruit in each bottle of Absolut Citron.",

        "description": "Amrut Distillery out of India makes this unique, and award-winning whiskey that blends peated Scottish barley along with Indian barley to create a unique flavorful mashbill that offers fresh fruit, smoke and spices.\n\nNose: Heavy, thickly oaked and complex: some curious barley-sugar notes here shrouded in soft smoke. Big, but seductively gentle, too.\nTaste: The delivery, though controlled at first, is massive! Then more like con-fusion as that smoke on the nose turns into warming, full blown peat, but it far from gets its own way as a vague sherry trifle note (curious, seeing how there are no sherry butts involved) - the custard presumably is oaky vanilla - hammers home that barley - fruitiness to make for a bit of a free-for-all; but for extra food measure the flavors develop into a really intense chocolate fudge middle which absolutely resonates through the palate\nFinish: A slight struggle here as the mouthfeel gets a bit puffy here with the dry peat and oak; enough molassed sweetness to see the malt through to a satisfying end, though. Above all the spices, rather than lying down and accepting their fate, rise up and usher this extraordinary whisky to its exit\nAlC / Vol.: 50%\nColour: Golden Yellow",

Once distilled, the liquid is matured in selected oak barrels. \n\nTo retain the natural characteristics of this oak-aged Indian single malt whisky, we do not chill filter and bottle it in its natural color, some haze may therefore be noticed.",

When we decided to release a rye, we knew it had to be something special to live up to the amazing response received by our bourbon finished in port barrels. Angel’s Envy Rye Finished in Rum Barrels is genuinely unique and worthy of Master Distiller Lincoln Henderson’s legacy. The taste profile of rye whiskey was a perfect fit for a rum cask finish. After sampling over 100 rums to find the right flavor to complement rye whiskey, the team’s decision was unanimous. Angel’s Envy spends up to 18 months finishing in Caribbean rum casks, resulting in an immensely complex whiskey. The mingling of raw, spicy and earthy rye with the mellow sweetness of rum finishing creates an incomparably smooth and drinkable whiskey, even at 100 proof.",

        "description": "A welcome new addition to the Ultimate range. Ardbeg An Oa is singularly rounded, due in no small part to time spent in our newly established bespoke oak Gathering Vat where whiskies from several cask types - including; sweet Pedro Ximenez; spicy virgin charred oak; and intense ex-bourbon casks, amongst others - familiarise themselves with each other. The result is a dram with smoky power, mellowed by a delectable, smooth sweetness. Hallmark Ardbeg peat, dark chocolate and aniseed are wrapped in smooth, silky butterscotch, black pepper and clove, before rising to an intense crescendo of flavour.\n\nNon chill-filtered",

Ardbeg Uigeadail was voted by the 120,000+ strong Ardbeg Committee as their favourite Ardbeg.\n\nNon chill-filtered",

The result is Ardbeg Wee Beastie and this tongue-tingling, beautifully smoky dram is the youngest Ardbeg we’ve ever made.\nOn the snout, intense aromas of cracked blacked pepper mingle with sappy pine resin and a sharp tang of smoke. Suddenly, an explosive mouthfeel bursts forth with chocolate, creosote, and tar. Savory meats sink into the palate before the long salty mouthcoating finish slinks away… revealing the inner beast of this Islay icon.\nYoung and intensely smoky, this is a dram untamed by age. Matured in ex-bourbon and Oloroso sherry casks, Wee Beastie is perfect for enjoying neat or as the mouth-watering main ingredient in a powerfully smoky cocktail.",
