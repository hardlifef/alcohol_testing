        "description": "Bulleit Bourbon is inspired by the whiskey pioneered by Augustus Bulleit over 150 years ago. Only ingredients of the very highest quality are used. The subtlety and complexity of Bulleit Bourbon come from its unique blend of rye, corn, and barley malt, along with special strains of yeast and pure Kentucky limestone filtered water. Due to its especially high rye content, Bulleit Bourbon has a bold, spicy character with a finish that&#39;s distinctively clean and smooth.\n\nMedium amber in color, with gentle spiciness and sweet oak aromas. Mid-palate is smooth with tones of maple, oak, and nutmeg. Finish is long, dry, and satiny with a light toffee flavor.",

Given some time to open up, a waft of smoke mingles with the fruity, malty scent. On the palate, the smoke really builds, but manages to hit the brakes before it overwhelms everything, fading into a burnt-orange, caramel finish. Pair with aged cheeses.",

This extra height allows a long interaction to take place between alcohol vapour and copper, and while the new make is decidedly high-toned [the cut points here are quite high] there is still a little note of cereal adding a dry counterpoint. The vast majority of Glenmorangie’s make is aged in ex-American oak casks. Some of the mature spirit is then transferred to ex-fortified wine [Port, Sherry] and still wine casks [Sauternes, Burgundy, Super Tuscan etc] for a period of finishing. Glenmorangie was one of the pioneers of this technique.",

        "description": "Hendrick&#39;s is an unusual gin created from eleven fine botanicals. The curious, yet marvelous, infusions of rose &amp; cucumber imbue our spirit with its uniquely balanced flavor resulting in an unimpeachably smooth and distinct gin.\nThe Hendrick’s Rickey is a beloved, refreshing and easy-to-make cocktail. However, Ms. Lesley Gracie, chooses to drink it with club soda, elderflower liqueur and garnished with 3 thinly sliced cucumber rounds.\nHand-crafted on the Southwest coast of Scotland in the decidedly un-ginnish town of Girvan, tiny batches of only 500 lovely litres are produced at a time, which gives Ms. Lesley Gracie, our Master Distiller and the inventor of Hendrick’s Gin, greater control of her careful artistry.\nHendrick’s Gin is created via an absurdly inefficient, yet quite glorious process. In essence, to make one gin, we first create two. One on an old-fashioned pot still, yielding a rich and intricate spirit. The other on along-necked Carter Head, producing a delicate, more refined spirit. Each still is infused with an unusual symphony of 11 botanicals. The gins from the two stills are then married together and graced with refreshing infusions of Rose and Cucumber.\nThis odd method of making gin enables Hendrick’s to taste light, yet intriguingly complex. The result is a wondrously refreshing gin with a delightfully floral aroma, elevating any cocktail and all occasions. \nEscape the conventional, and embrace the delectable.",

Fine agave, herbal and green apple aroma notes tantalize with a balanced and slightly woody taste, finishing medium- to full-bodied. Sip neat, on the rocks or give your margaritas a top-shelf treatment with this pale straw-colored tequila. Hailing from Tequila, Jalisco in Mexico, Hornitos Tequila (named after the “little ovens” used to roast agave) was introduced to the world in 1950 by founder Don Francisco Javier Sauza in honor of Mexican Independence Day.",

        "description": "Our premium, 86-proof bourbon whiskey spends years longer being aged in our American White Oak barrels than our original Jim Beam. It’s those extra years of aging that give Jim Beam Black its full-bodied flavor with notes of smooth caramel and warm oak.\n\nWhat do you do when awarded the International Wine &amp; Spirits Competition’s 2016 Bourbon Trophy? You don’t change a thing. That’s why Jim Beam Black is, and always will be, extra-aged to taste and bottled only when it’s just right. The result is a full-bodied bourbon with an extra level of elegance and refinement that’s meant to be sipped and savored. And of course, just like its younger brother, our original Jim Beam®, it’s best when shared with others.",

        "description": "The original recipe for Rebel Yell dates back to 1849, when it was invented at what would later become the Stitzel-Weller Distillery. Although many famous bourbons were produced at the Stitzel-Weller Distillery (including Pappy Van Winkle), most shared one unique characteristic pioneered by William Laurel Weller himself — instead of rye, the bourbons used wheat as a secondary grain in their mashbill, lending a softer, smoother flavor to the whiskey.\n\nIn 1936, nearly a century after the original recipe was developed, former Louisville Mayor Charles F. Farnsley officially registered the &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; brand, distilling the bourbon limited batches for exclusive distribution in the southern United States. This practice lasted all the way into the 1980s, when the Stitzel-Weller Distillery was disbanded and Rebel Yell found its way into the hands of LUXCO Spirited Brands. Now, more than 150 years later, Rebel Yell is bridging the gap between its proud heritage and modern tastes, and is available nationwide for the first time in its history.\n\nRebel Yell Small Batch Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey is handcrafted according to the original, time-honored Rebel Yell recipe developed in 1849. Bottled at a slightly higher proof (90.6) than Rebel Yell Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, the Small Batch Reserve has a complex aroma of caramel, oak, vanilla and brown sugar, which leads to similar flavors on the palate, along with notes of wheat crackers and sugar cereal. The finish is subtle, with hints of orange peel and dark chocolate rounding things out.",

Rye Whiskey stands for, some think it&#39;s for &quot;very old&quot;, but family speculates that it actually stands for &quot;Very Own.&quot; Nonetheless, this whisky blend created for Joseph E. Seagram&#39;s own family, to celebrate his son&#39;s upcoming marriage. Upon tasting the special blend, everyone insisted it be put on the market and sure enough it went on to become one of Seagram&#39;s biggest sellers. Earlier bottlings of the VO carried an age-statement of 6 years although new iterations of the popular whisky have been replaced with a no-age-statement blend. This has changed the taste a bit, but not the quality. Notes: Smooth, medium-bodied. Aromas and flavors of caramel, apricot, lemon oak and coffee Pairings: Duck, grilled mushrooms, pecan pie Serving Suggestions: On the rocks or mixed into your favorite cocktail Region: Canada Alcohol Content: 40%",

Crafted in small-batches using a one of a kind micro-still, Harlen’s unique wheat recipe is distilled a total of 10 times, triple-filtered and bottled at 82 proof, creating a delicate and balanced profile. This is a craft vodka that is made to be tasted for what it is, while being able to stand up in a cocktail. Pure and crisp on the nose, with a clean taste and hints of soft vanilla, Wheatley Vodka delivers the kind of exceptional quality and taste you would expect from the world’s most award-winning distillery.\nWHY LIMESTONE WATER?\n“The water in this area is filtered through limestone. It really does two things: it filters out things like iron and adds things like magnesium and calcium. Those two things combined are perfect for distilling. A good, clean, fresh water is just as important as the vodka itself.”\nWHY WHEAT?\n“One of the things that we learned through distilling wheated bourbons is we know what that adds to the flavor of the distillate. It’s a good ingredient to give it that soft, delicate finish that we like in a craft vodka. We use the same red winter wheat grain that we use for all the Weller and Pappy Van Winkle bourbons.”\nWHY 10 TIMES DISTILLED?\n“Each time you distill it, you’re mellowing out that vodka. What really sets us apart is the fact that we’re marrying a seven-times distilled wheat recipe with another seven-times distilled grain recipe and then distilling it three more times. So for us, we felt like 10 times distilled was just right for the craft style vodka we’re going for.”\nWHY 82 PROOF?\n“We know when bartenders are making cocktails, they want that spirit to show through. It’s easier to do with an 82 proof and it allows you to showcase that flavor a little more.”",

        "description": "Craft Distilled by Master Distiller Harlen Wheatley and his dedicated team at the Distillery, Wheatley Vodka is made in small batches using Harlen’s one of a kind micro-still and a unique recipe of wheat and other grains. Distilled a total of 10 times, triple filtered, and bottled at 82 proof, this artisanal vodka has a clean, crisp, and fresh taste.  Harlen has always wanted to make a premium vodka​ and knows from experience that wheat offers a delicate and balanced flavor profile. The wheat recipe is cooked, fermented, and distilled seven times on the micro-still before being married with a recipe made from other grains and distilled an additional three times.  As Harlen describes it, &quot;This is how vodka is supposed to taste.&quot;\n\nTASTING NOTES:\nPure and crisp on the nose. The fresh and clean taste finishes with hint of soft vanilla. This is the way vodka should taste.\n\nAWARDS:\n2018 Silver Medal - San Francisco World Spirits Competition\n2018 &quot;Great Value&quot; - 90 points - Ultimate Spirits Challenge\n\nREVIEWS:\n&quot;Crisp intense nose with slightly grainy notes.
