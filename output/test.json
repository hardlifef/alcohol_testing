        "description": "Founded by sixth-generation Texan, Tito Beveridge, Tito’s Handmade Vodka is known for its high-quality product, charitable contributions, and goal to make people happy while making the world a better place. From the start, Tito got a kick out of infusing vodka for friends and quickly became known as “the vodka guy.” With a dream to do what he loved, and a dog by his side, he pursued a career in the spirits industry, risking it all until he sold his first case. \n\nOver twenty-five years later, Tito’s Handmade Vodka has stayed true to its roots and is designed to be savored by both spirit connoisseurs and those who enjoy a simple cocktail. Our gluten-free, low-calorie* vodka is American-made, unflavored, and distilled using old-fashioned copper pot stills, inspired by the distillation methods of fine single malt scotches and high-end French cognacs. Over 25 years later, the process remains the same; Tito’s is made in batches, with each batch taste-tested, and goes down smooth with an impeccably clean finish. From a Bloody Mary at brunch, a martini at cocktail hour, or a simple Tito’s and soda with friends – just add Tito’s and enjoy! Distilled and bottled on the same land in Austin, Texas, Tito’s Handmade Vodka is made from 100% corn and is naturally gluten-free. Available in Liter, 1.75L, 750mL, 375mL, 200mL, and 50mL sizes. \n\n*(Average Analysis per 1.5oz Tito’s Handmade Vodka: 98 calories, Carbohydrates 0 grams, Protein 0 grams, Fat 0 grams)",

Due to its especially high rye content, Bulleit Bourbon has a bold, spicy character with a finish that&#39;s distinctively clean and smooth.\n\nMedium amber in color, with gentle spiciness and sweet oak aromas. Mid-palate is smooth with tones of maple, oak, and nutmeg. Finish is long, dry, and satiny with a light toffee flavor.",

This extra height allows a long interaction to take place between alcohol vapour and copper, and while the new make is decidedly high-toned [the cut points here are quite high] there is still a little note of cereal adding a dry counterpoint. The vast majority of Glenmorangie’s make is aged in ex-American oak casks. Some of the mature spirit is then transferred to ex-fortified wine [Port, Sherry] and still wine casks [Sauternes, Burgundy, Super Tuscan etc] for a period of finishing. Glenmorangie was one of the pioneers of this technique.",

        "description": "Hendrick&#39;s is an unusual gin created from eleven fine botanicals. The curious, yet marvelous, infusions of rose &amp; cucumber imbue our spirit with its uniquely balanced flavor resulting in an unimpeachably smooth and distinct gin.\nThe Hendrick’s Rickey is a beloved, refreshing and easy-to-make cocktail. However, Ms. Lesley Gracie, chooses to drink it with club soda, elderflower liqueur and garnished with 3 thinly sliced cucumber rounds.\nHand-crafted on the Southwest coast of Scotland in the decidedly un-ginnish town of Girvan, tiny batches of only 500 lovely litres are produced at a time, which gives Ms. Lesley Gracie, our Master Distiller and the inventor of Hendrick’s Gin, greater control of her careful artistry.\nHendrick’s Gin is created via an absurdly inefficient, yet quite glorious process. In essence, to make one gin, we first create two. One on an old-fashioned pot still, yielding a rich and intricate spirit. The other on along-necked Carter Head, producing a delicate, more refined spirit. Each still is infused with an unusual symphony of 11 botanicals. The gins from the two stills are then married together and graced with refreshing infusions of Rose and Cucumber.\nThis odd method of making gin enables Hendrick’s to taste light, yet intriguingly complex. The result is a wondrously refreshing gin with a delightfully floral aroma, elevating any cocktail and all occasions. \nEscape the conventional, and embrace the delectable.",

And of course, just like its younger brother, our original Jim Beam®, it’s best when shared with others.",

With a sharp and sweet aroma, this Kentucky bourbon features a strong floral character that swirls with hints of mint, rich tobacco leaf and vanilla. This hard liquor is sharp at first, but softens quickly to deliver hints of spice and light orange notes. The finish is long, warm and slightly drying with a nice level of sweetness. Try this whisky in mixed drinks, like an Old Fashioned cocktail, mix it with a splash of water, or simply enjoy it neat in your favorite glass. Please Sip Responsibly.",

        "description": "The original recipe for Rebel Yell dates back to 1849, when it was invented at what would later become the Stitzel-Weller Distillery. Although many famous bourbons were produced at the Stitzel-Weller Distillery (including Pappy Van Winkle), most shared one unique characteristic pioneered by William Laurel Weller himself — instead of rye, the bourbons used wheat as a secondary grain in their mashbill, lending a softer, smoother flavor to the whiskey.\n\nIn 1936, nearly a century after the original recipe was developed, former Louisville Mayor Charles F. Farnsley officially registered the &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; brand, distilling the bourbon limited batches for exclusive distribution in the southern United States. This practice lasted all the way into the 1980s, when the Stitzel-Weller Distillery was disbanded and Rebel Yell found its way into the hands of LUXCO Spirited Brands. Now, more than 150 years later, Rebel Yell is bridging the gap between its proud heritage and modern tastes, and is available nationwide for the first time in its history.\n\nRebel Yell Small Batch Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey is handcrafted according to the original, time-honored Rebel Yell recipe developed in 1849. Bottled at a slightly higher proof (90.6) than Rebel Yell Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, the Small Batch Reserve has a complex aroma of caramel, oak, vanilla and brown sugar, which leads to similar flavors on the palate, along with notes of wheat crackers and sugar cereal. The finish is subtle, with hints of orange peel and dark chocolate rounding things out.",

It&#39;s all followed by that unmistakable smoothness of pure honey to keep you thirsty for more.",
