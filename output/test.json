From the start, Tito got a kick out of infusing vodka for friends and quickly became known as “the vodka guy.” With a dream to do what he loved, and a dog by his side, he pursued a career in the spirits industry, risking it all until he sold his first case. \n\nOver twenty-five years later, Tito’s Handmade Vodka has stayed true to its roots and is designed to be savored by both spirit connoisseurs and those who enjoy a simple cocktail. Our gluten-free, low-calorie* vodka is American-made, unflavored, and distilled using old-fashioned copper pot stills, inspired by the distillation methods of fine single malt scotches and high-end French cognacs. Over 25 years later, the process remains the same; Tito’s is made in batches, with each batch taste-tested, and goes down smooth with an impeccably clean finish. From a Bloody Mary at brunch, a martini at cocktail hour, or a simple Tito’s and soda with friends – just add Tito’s and enjoy! Distilled and bottled on the same land in Austin, Texas, Tito’s Handmade Vodka is made from 100% corn and is naturally gluten-free. Available in Liter, 1.75L, 750mL, 375mL, 200mL, and 50mL sizes. \n\n*(Average Analysis per 1.5oz Tito’s Handmade Vodka: 98 calories, Carbohydrates 0 grams, Protein 0 grams, Fat 0 grams)","Address":"7066 Hwy 70 S, Nashville, TN 37221, USA","PhoneNumber":"+16156461400","price":19.99,"priceCurrency":"USD","ratingValue":4.4,"Content":"40% ABV","Type":"Spirits","Subtype":"Gluten Free ,Kosher ,","Vodka":"Country","United_States":"State","Texas":"Region"},{"name":"Bacardi Superior Light Rum","url":"https://shopredspirits.com/shop?product-id=61377c508effb63f2ea54fc8&option-id=1fe13179171357eb86e1c48a16848ae0662ffb6b291b1500262526847ef4f20b","image":"https://d3omj40jjfp5tk.cloudfront.net/products/628ea1e82b28c327299635a8/large.png","description":"BACARDÍ Superior Rum is a light and aromatically balanced rum.

This extra height allows a long interaction to take place between alcohol vapour and copper, and while the new make is decidedly high-toned [the cut points here are quite high] there is still a little note of cereal adding a dry counterpoint. The vast majority of Glenmorangie’s make is aged in ex-American oak casks. Some of the mature spirit is then transferred to ex-fortified wine [Port, Sherry] and still wine casks [Sauternes, Burgundy, Super Tuscan etc] for a period of finishing. Glenmorangie was one of the pioneers of this technique.","Address":"7066 Hwy 70 S, Nashville, TN 37221, USA","PhoneNumber":"+16156461400","price":39.99,"priceCurrency":"USD","ratingValue":5,"Age":"10","Type":"Spirits","Subtype":"Scotch ,Single Malt ,","Whiskey":"Country","Scotland":"Sub Region"},{"name":"Gosling&#39;s Black Seal Rum","url":"https://shopredspirits.com/shop?product-id=56cab25b7562752ed5ba1600&option-id=dc4fdebcfee36fd1a2dc8e91ecac42f8e552ff5db751bc30786c43609c84e9db","image":"https://d3omj40jjfp5tk.cloudfront.net/products/58b2c5e101ff956011652d37/large.png","description":"Today, unlike most spirits, Black Seal includes products of both pot stills, as used in fine Cognacs, and continuous stills, as used in grappa. One imparts flavour, the other yields a subtle elegance. Together they work wonders.\n\nGosling’s Black Seal has a rich, intricate flavour, well balanced and nuanced with butterscotch, vanilla and caramel. Or, as expressed up by the Beverage Tasting Institute when they awarded it their highest honor, the Platinum Medal: “Deep, assertive and highly flavoured. Very fragrant with herbal ￼￼￼￼￼￼sharpness. At the finish there is a softness and elegance. A most complex, unusual spirit.” We were pleased, but hardly surprised. After all, we’ve been at this awhile.","Address":"7066 Hwy 70 S, Nashville, TN 37221, USA","PhoneNumber":"+16156461400","price":36.99,"priceCurrency":"USD","ratingValue":5,"Content":"40%","Type":"Spirits","Subtype":"Rum","Country":"Bermuda"}]
